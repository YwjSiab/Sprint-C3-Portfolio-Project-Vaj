    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>My name is Ywj Siab Vaj</strong>, I am 22 years old and I currently live in Schofield, WI. 
            I began wanting to go into web design in order to help people ranging from small business owners to large companies with fixing their websites. 
            My goal is to be able to help bring more traction to their sites by making their sites easier to use for all demog of people.</p>
        <p>I like working on things that can push my intellegence wether it be projects or something simple like a puzzles.  I like finding out new
                solutions or new awnsers to problems I have been stuck on.  As long as there's a problem to solve I'm bound to work at it with multiple different ideas.</p>
        <p>I always had a love for gaming.  I started playing games at the age of 8 with my brothers and loved the action of games such as Call of Duty, League of Legends and 
                World of Warcraft.  My love for gaming has almost always had me on a computer, console or both.  I have always wanted to create my own game or a website to share games.</p>
